‚úÖ **1. Built-in IPsec (Internet Protocol Security)**

- **IPv4:**  
    IPsec is optional; it was added later and is not always implemented or used.
    
- **IPv6:**  
    IPsec is mandatory ‚Äî all IPv6 devices must support it in the protocol stack.
    
    ‚Üí This enables:
    
    - Data confidentiality (encryption)
        
    - Data integrity (detection of tampering)
        
    - Authentication (verifying sender‚Äôs identity)
        

‚ö† **Important:** While IPsec is required to be _available_ in IPv6, it is not automatically _enabled_. Admins still need to configure and manage it.

---

‚úÖ **2. Simplified network design (no NAT)**

- **IPv4:**  
    Uses NAT (Network Address Translation) to deal with address shortages. NAT hides private networks, but:
    
    - Breaks true end-to-end encryption
        
    - Complicates IPsec and VPNs
        
    - Makes troubleshooting harder
        
- **IPv6:**  
    Has an enormous address space, so **no NAT is needed**.
    
    - Restores **end-to-end connectivity**
        
    - Allows simpler, more secure peer-to-peer communication
        
    - Makes IPsec easier to use
        

---

‚úÖ **3. Improved neighbor discovery with secure options**

- IPv6 replaces ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) with **Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)**.
    
- NDP can use **Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)** to prevent spoofing and certain local attacks.
    
- IPv4‚Äôs ARP is inherently insecure and easily spoofed.
    

---

‚úÖ **4. Extension headers for better control**

- IPv6 allows **extension headers** for things like routing, security, and mobility.
    
- This modularity allows the network to implement **new security features** more easily in the future.
