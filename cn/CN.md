repeater - layer 1 - duplicates the signal and forwards
hub - layer 1 - broadcasts the signal
switch - layer 2 - stores MAC address table, sends data to unique recepient in LAN
bridge - layer 2 - connects 2 LAN segments that operate on SAME PROTOCOL, repeater + mac address capability
router - layer 3 - take forwarding decision based on IP address, connects two LANs
multi layer switch - can be layer 2 as well as layer 3 (switch + router)
brouter - bridge + router
modem - modulator demodulator
