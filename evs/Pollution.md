- air pollution is major cause
- chemicals in fertilizers are necessary but damage soil if overused

# Source of air pollution

![[Pasted image 20250520183417.png]]

## Man made/Anthropogenic sources

- population explosion
chain reaction
zyada population -> global warming and more emission of greenhouse gasses -> rise in sea levels 

increase in demand for food and land -> deforestation

- burning of fossil fuels
produces by products such as CO2, CO, CH4, SO2 and oxides of nitrogen 

![[Pasted image 20250520183621.png]]

- vehicular discharges
75% air pollution caused by vehicles
![[Pasted image 20250520183709.png]]

- rapid industrialization
chemical mills, pulp mills, metallurgical plant smelters, petroleum refineries, mining, synthetic rubber industries discharge gaseous, liquid and particulate type pollutants

- agricultural activities
insecticide, pesticide, herbicides pollute the air through air currents

- modern warfare
radioactive from nuclear power plants, explosions and modern war explosives

- smoking
causes health diseases, due to carcinogenic tar

# Types of Air Pollutants

## Primary
![[Pasted image 20250520184059.png]]

- oxides of carbon
from vehicular discharge
CO produced by vehicles, incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, volcanic eruptions, forest fires
displaces oxygen from haemoglobin in blood reducing oxygen supply
fatal if conc. exceeding 1000 ppm
![[Pasted image 20250520184253.png]]

CO2 not very harmful, but in high conc. (above 10%) causes greenhouse effect, acid rain, global warming

- nitrogen oxides
90% nitrogen oxides from diesel engines, also from electrical power plants, industrial, commercial and residential units
harmless at room temp, but at high temp -> combines with oxygen -> forms nitrous oxide (NO) and causes asphyxiation at high conc.
root cause of lung cancer, pneumonia, internal bleeding and inflammation

- hydrocarbons
by automobiles, also some plants like coniferae family
carcinogenic at high conc. (500 - 1000 ppm)
inhalation causes irritation of mucus membrane -> blockage of respiratory track

react with nitrogen oxides to produce photochemical smog that causes irritation to eyes, nose, throat and respiratory distress
plants exposed to HC show yellow leaves

- sulphur oxides 
coal fired electrical power plants, industries

reacts with ozone, water vapours -> sulfuric acid -> acid rain
corrodes limestone, metal
harmful for lungs

- particulate matter

**effects of PM on human beings**
PM10 -> less than 10 microns, filtered by nose
PM2.5 -> goes deep into lungs and damages tissue causes black lung, silicosis, bronchitis

RSPM -> Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (< 10 microns)
carcinogenic

**effects** on plants
block stomata -> reduce transpiration, respiration and photosynthesis -> death

accelerates corrosion of metals, buildings

**effects on climate**
reduce visibility by absorbing and scattering solar radiation
influence formation of clouds, rain and snow and act as nuclei for water condesation
-> affects precipitation (acid rain)

## Secondary pollutants

primary pollutants -> react with atmospheric compounds

- ozone formed by photochemical reaction bw primary and atm. comp.
affects respiratory and nervous system damages rubber products

- PAN Poly Acetyl Nitrate causes photochemical smog

block leaves stomata

# Water Pollution

![[Pasted image 20250520191258.png]]

## Freshwater Pollution
- includes both ground and surface water
- may be natural/man made
![[Pasted image 20250520191402.png]]


excessive use of nitrogenous fertilizers -> seepage of water with soluble nitrous salts into aquifier -> pollutes ground water -> drank by humans -> methemoglobinemia in infants

## Marine Water Pollution

# Sources of Water Pollution

## Surface Water Pollution

sewage discharged -> decrease Dissolve Oxygen levels

![[Pasted image 20250520194309.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250520194323.png]]

presence of oxygen demanding waste decreases DO

![[Pasted image 20250520194512.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250520194547.png]]

- industrial waste
![[Pasted image 20250520194747.png]]
- agricultural chemicals
excessive storage of potassium and phosphorus increases algae growth -> decrease in DO levels
nitrogenous waste -> methemoglobinemia 
pesticides -> long lasting effects, targeted + untargeted
- thermal and radioactive waste
- biodegradable and non biodegradable 
- eutrophication
![[Pasted image 20250520195301.png]]
- biological magnification
![[Pasted image 20250520195329.png]]

- heavy metals
- ground water pollution
![[Pasted image 20250520195628.png]]
- biological contamination of water
