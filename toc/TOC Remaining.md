# Modification of Turing Machine

	1. Can be modified using read write heads (increase read write heads)
Theorem: A language L is accepted by a turing machine with k read write heads if it is accepted by one read write head

	2. By making input tape from 1D to be 2D or 3d
Theorem: A machine can be accepted by n-dimensional tape if and only if it is accepted by 1D tape

we can apply speed up process but computing capability remains the same
	1. By increasing memory space (more stacks)
just speeds up the machine

recursive enumerable is subset of all else, undecidable

undecidable -> algorithm can't be made
